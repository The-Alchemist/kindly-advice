Kindly-advice is a small library to advise Clojure data visualization and notebook tools how to display forms and values, following the [Kindly](https://github.com/scicloj/kindly) convention.

## Status
Kindly-advice will stabilize soon and is currently getting feedback from tool-makers.

## Example

```clj
(require '[scicloj.kindly.v4.kind :as kind]
         '[scicloj.kindly-advice.v1.api :as kindly-advice])
```

Asking for advice for given value (optionally annotated by Kindly):
```clj
(kindly-advice/advise {:value (kind/hiccup
                               [:div [:h1 "hello"]])})

;; => 
{:value [:div [:h1 "hello"]],
 :meta-kind :kind/hiccup,
 :kind :kind/hiccup,
 :advice
 [[:kind/hiccup {:reason :metadata}]
  [:kind/vector {:reason :predicate}]
  [:kind/seq {:reason :predicate}]]}

```

The `:kind` field is the important one, expressing the bottom line of the inference: `kindly-advice` recommends the tool handles this value as Hiccup.

The tool's job will usually be to display the `:value` field based on the `:kind` field.

Asking for advice for given form (optionally annotated by Kindly). The form is evaluated to produce the value. Kindly-advice checks both the form and value for metadata. The metadata might not be present on the value.

```clj
(kindly-advice/advise {:form
                       ^:kind/hiccup
                       [:div [:h1 "hello"]]})

;; => 
{:form [:div [:h1 "hello"]],
 :value [:div [:h1 "hello"]],
 :meta-kind :kind/hiccup,
 :kind :kind/hiccup,
 :advice
 [[:kind/hiccup {:reason :metadata}]
  [:kind/vector {:reason :predicate}]
  [:kind/seq {:reason :predicate}]]}
```

Sometimes, there is no inferred kind, as no metadata or relevant predicates say anything useful:

```clj

(kindly-advice/advise {:form '(+ 1 2)})
;; =>
{:form (+ 1 2), :value 3, :meta-kind nil, :advice []}
```

In some situations, the kind inferred by predicates. Kindly-advice has a list of default predicates, which can be extended by the user. In the following eexample, it recognizes a dataset created by Tablecloth.

```clj
(require '[tablecloth.api :as tc])
(kindly-advice/advise {:value (tc/dataset {:x (range 4)})})

;; =>
{:value _unnamed [4 1]:

 | :x |
 |---:|
 |  0 |
 |  1 |
 |  2 |
 |  3 |
 ,
 :meta-kind nil,
 :kind :kind/dataset,
 :advice
 [[:kind/dataset {:reason :predicate}]
  [:kind/map {:reason :predicate}]]}

```
